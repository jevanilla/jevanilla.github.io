    "text": "Selected Projects\n\nMaine Shellfish Biotoxin Forecasting\nAnnual occurrence of paralytic shellfish poison (PSP) across the coast of Maine poses a challenge for fishery managers who implement regional harvesting closures to protect human health. Similarly, shellfish growers and harvesters also must make decisions to operate their businesses in the face of these closures. Two process-based predictive models exist that deliver seasonal and weekly Alexandrium catenella bloom potential forecasts. A more recently developed machine-learning model predicts the probabilistic risk of PSP accumulation in shellfish at a site-specific, weekly timescale. The latter model was developed with shellfish industry members and managers, to produce the most usable forecast possible. Through two seasons of delivering predictions in an experimental mode, the forecast has achieved high accuracy and received positive feedback from its users. Both the process-based and machine learning models provide important, but different insights for their users. While the process-based models capture a suite of environmental conditions that may lead to blooms of A. catenella, high cell concentrations cannot always predict spikes in toxicity. On the other hand, the machine learning model excels at predicting toxicity at a finer (weekly) timescale, but loses skill with longer lead times (&gt; two weeks). Combining the two model types is being explored.\n\n\nBlue Mussel Spat Settlement in Coastal Maine\nMytilus edulis (blue mussel) seed availability is the biggest bottleneck in the Maine mussel aquaculture industry. Perna canaliculus spat settlement was demonstrated to be predicted with high accuracy 1 month ahead using historical spat collection records and 1 month of prior environmental covariates in New Zealand (Atalah, 2019). Originally suggested as a research idea from a mussel grower in Maine, a mussel spat settlement forecast would aid the industry in the annual process of collecting new mussels to grow. We conducted a survey of available mussel seed colleciton efforts in Maine, and attempted to look for relationships with environmental covariates.\n\n\nAssessing Marine Protected Area Success with OBIS Data\nThe Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS) provides a global repository of marine species occurrence records. Using boundaries of marine protected areas (MPAs) around the world, species records were queried from OBIS for each MPA and used to calculate a biodiversity metric over 20 year time increments. Some of the guiding questions were: Is biodiversity in an MPA related to its size, age or distance from shore? The project team was formed during OceanHackWeek 2021 and continued to meet regularly for a year following the event. The analysis and tools developed for the project are located in this repo.\n\n\nSeriola dorsalis Aquaculture Genomics\nAs a candidate species for aquaculture in Southern California, genomic resources are necessary to accelerate the development of Seriola dorsalis aquaculture. With knowledge of genetic basis behind locally adapted traits between wild populations of important aquaculture species, individuals that possess these valuable phenotypes can be used for selective breeding in aquaculture. In this study, a population genomic tool, Bayescan version 2.1, was implemented on a dataset of 76,974 loci of SNPs found within the genome of S. dorsalis, in order to search for loci being selected for based on allele frequencies between the three populations. No loci were found to have a probability of being naturally selected for higher than 11.042%, which does not provide any evidence of locally adapted, population specific traits that could be exploited through selective breeding in aquaculture. Based on these results, any fish taken from the region surrounding the three sample locations would possess similar traits, and the three populations can be managed as one.\n\n\nFish Stock Genetic Diversity\nMany current fishery stock assessment methods strongly rely on the amount of fish harvest reported at the dock by fishermen. We seek a method for fish stock assessment that is based on transcriptome measures. In this study we were interested in the correlation between transcriptome level diversity and changes in the phenotype expression ability of commercially targeted fish. By analyzing the complexity of miRNA/RNAi 7mer binding sites in the 3’UTR regions, inferences are made as to the accessible repertoire of phenotypes for the organism. If fewer phenotypes are available, for use in response to environmental change, or for use in extending habitable niche, such as by ‘schooling’, then significant loss of fishery stock may result. Preliminary results indicate Gadus Morhua (Atlantic Cod) has undergone such a loss in transcript regulatory complexity, which appears to be associated with the collapse of the Cod fishery in the Gulf of Maine."

    "text": "I’m a research associate at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Science, working in the Tandy Center for Ocean Forecasting.\nHere’s some pieces of the story leading up to my current role:\nIn September 2007, I caught my first tuna: an albacore (Thunnus alalunga). While I had fished on the ocean prior, this one fish sparked the passion that has remained to this day.\n\nIn high school, I was selected to be a member of the Seeker Fishing Rods Junior Pro Staff team, helping to represent the company on fishing trips and trade shows. Here’s a shot from the 2012 Fred Hall Show in Long Beach, CA.\n\nA few years later (2014), after a call to their front desk, I landed a summer volunteer position at NOAA’s Southwest Fisheries Science Center. I spent a lot of early mornings catching sportfishing boats as they returned to the San Diego landings to measure their tuna as they unloaded.\n\nThe next summer (2015), just after I graduated high school and right before I swapped coasts to attend Connecticut College, I was given the opportunity to volunteer on a leg of the SaKe Cruise on the RV Bell M Shimada. While part of the cruise’s mission was to survey coastal pelagic species, like the box of CA market squid (Doryteuthis opalescens) shown in the first picture, I was lucky to be participating during a strong El Nino event, which turned up some big bags of pelagic red crab (Pleuroncodes planipes).\n\n\nA few years into college, my interest in fisheries biology remained strong as ever. By getting selected for the Richard H. Goodwin Environmental Research Fellowship, I received funding to complete a summer internship at the institution of my choosing. The choice in my mind was clear: return to SWFSC.\nThe summer (2018) was filled with Thunnus orientalis dissections. At this point, the San Diego sportfishing fleet had improved its skill at catching the larger fish, so there were plenty to cut open like these.\n\nA highlight of the summer started as a standard day of fishing kelp paddies about 30nm from Mission Bay. A live mackerel and 15lb test was the secret to hooking the fish that Matt Craig (left) and Owyn Snodgrass (right) had been trying to catch for years on rod and reel leading up to this day: an opah (Lampris guttatus). It’s safe to say that I blew both of their minds.\n\n\nConnecticut College happened to be right across the street from the US Coast Guard Academy. During the prior spring (2018), I found myself sitting in a fisheries management course where my classmates were future USCG officers. One day, a local commercial fisherman, Captain Mike Theiler, came in to give a guest lecture. After chatting briefly after class, I landed a part time job working on a few of his boats.\n\n\nWith some commercial fishing experience, my first job out of college was at Commercial Fisheries Research Foundation assisting with a project to test an experimental scallop dredge design called the N-viro Dredge. While it was great to be in constant contact with the commercial fishing industry of Rhode Island, I wasn’t writing any code.\n\n\nIn December 2022, I traveled to Casablanca, Morocco with my boss Nick to participate in the IOC-UNESCO workshop: Stakeholder Needs Assessment for Establishing an Early Warning System (EWS) for Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) in Morocco. The three day workshop featured lots of discussion and a few programming tutorial sessions.\n\nUpon returning, I left Maine and made the cross country journey to end up in Seattle, WA, my current home base.\n\nRecently I had the opportunity to join another coastal pelagic cruise in September 2023. I spent some time getting to know the daytime acoustics operations and saw a small school of bait."
