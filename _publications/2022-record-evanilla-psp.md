**Abstract** Paralytic shellfish poison (PSP) is a human health concern for shellfish aquaculture and
wild harvest. This paper discusses lessons learned from a forecasting program for PSP in
coastal Maine, USA, designed based on stakeholder input, and run in an operational
mode for the 2021 season. The forecast uses a deep learning algorithm to make sitespecific,
probabilistic forecasts at a weekly forecast range for toxin levels measured in
shellfish tissue. Forecasts had high accuracy in the 2021 season, correctly predicting
closure events and locations despite a highly unusual season. Stakeholders reported a
positive view of the forecast system, and stakeholder input continues to be of key
importance as further modifications are made to the system. There are benefits and
challenges to the stakeholder-based design of the system.
