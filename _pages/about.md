I'm a research associate at [Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Science](https://www.bigelow.org/), working in the [Tandy Center for Ocean Forecasting](https://www.bigelow.org/services/ocean-forecasting/).

Here's some pieces of the story leading up to my current role:

In September 2007,

In high school, I was selected to be a member of the [Seeker Fishing Rods](https://seekerrods.com/) Junior Pro Staff team, helping to represent the company on fishing trips and trade shows. Here's a shot from the 2012 Fred Hall Show in Long Beach, CA.

A few years later (2014), after a call to their front desk, I landed a summer volunteer position at NOAA's Southwest Fisheries Science Center. which featured a lot of bluefin tuna fork length measurements at the San Diego sportfishing landings.

The next summer (2015), just after I graduated high school and right before I swapped coasts to attend Connecticut College, I was given the opportunity to volunteer on a leg of the SaKe Cruise. I was lucky to be participating during a strong El Nino event, which turned up some big bags of pelagic red crab (second picture).

A few years into college, my interest in fisheries biology remained strong as ever. By getting selected for the Richard H. Goodwin Environmental Research Fellowship, I received funding to complete a summer internship at the institution of my choosing. The choice in my mind was clear: return to SWFSC.

The summer (2018) was filled with *Thunnus orientalis* dissections. At this point, the San Diego sportfishing fleet had improved its skill at catching the larger fish, so there were plenty to cut open like these.

A highlight of the summer started as a standard day of fishing kelp paddies about 30nm from Mission Bay. A live mackerel and 15lb test was the secret to hooking the fish that [Owyn Snodgrass](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25977549/) and [Matt Craig]() had been trying to catch for years on rod and reel leading up to this day: an opah (*Lampris guttatus*). It's safe to say that I blew both of their minds.

Connecticut College happened to be right across the street from the US Coast Guard Academy. During the prior spring (2018), I found myself sitting in a fisheries management course where my classmates were future USCG officiers. One day, a local commercial fisherman, Captain Mike Theiler, came in to give a guest lecture. After chatting briefly after class, I landed a part time job working on a few of his boats.

With some commercial fishing experience, my first job out of college was at [Commercial Fisheries Research Foundation](https://www.cfrfoundation.org/) assisting with a project to test an experimental scallop dredge design called the [N-viro Dredge](). While it was great to be in constant contact with the commercial fishing industry of RHode Island, I wasn't writing any code.
